# Method to create a bootable USB:
## 1:Using a tool 
First, install the operating system ISO file that you want. Afterwards, you will need to install a tool that helps format and create the bootable USB.   
For example, you can use Rufus or FormatUsb.    
Insert your USB drive and make sure there is nothing on it.    
Lauche the tool and select the USB drive.    
Pick the partition scheme (MBR or GPT), file system (NTFS or FAT32), and other options.     
Start the process and wait until it is done.    
You should now have a bootable USB. If it doesn't work, do the steps again or re-install the tool and the ISO file.
